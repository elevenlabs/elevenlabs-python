The official Python API for [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) [text-to-speech software.](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) Eleven brings the most compelling, rich and lifelike voices to creators and developers in just a few lines of code.

## üìñ API & Docs

Check out the [HTTP API documentation](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install

```bash
pip install elevenlabs
```

## V3 Migration Guide
> The SDK was rewritten in v3 and is now programatically generated from our OpenAPI spec. As part of this release 
> there are some breaking changes. 


### Client Instantiation
The SDK now exports a client class that you must instantiate to call various
endpoints in our API. 

```python
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs

client = ElevenLabs(api_key="...")
```
As part of this change, there is no longer a `set_api_key` and `get_api_key` method exported. 

### HTTPX
The SDK now uses httpx under the hood. This allows us to export an async client in addition to 
a synchronous client. Note that you can pass in your own httpx client as well. 

```python
from elevenlabs.client import AsyncElevenLabs

client = AsyncElevenLabs(api_key="...", httpx=httpx.AsyncClient(...))
```

### Removing Static Methods
There are no longer static methods exposed directly on objects. For example, 
instead of `Models.from_api()` you can now do `client.models.get_all()`. 

The renames are specified below: 

  `User.from_api()` -> `client.users.get()`

  `Models.from_api()` -> `client.models.get_all()`

  `Voices.from_api()` -> `client.voices.get_all()` 

  `History.from_api()` -> `client.history.get_all()` 


### Maintaining Helper Methods
The SDK continues to export methods for `generate`, `play`, `clone`, and
`voices` which are detailed in the README below. 

## üó£Ô∏è Usage
[![Open in Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó-Open%20in%20Spaces-blue.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/elevenlabs/tts)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/flavioschneider/49468d728a816c6538fd2f56b3b50b96/elevenlabs-python.ipynb)

We support two main models: the newest `eleven_multilingual_v2`, a single foundational model supporting 29 languages including English, Chinese, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, French, German, Japanese, Arabic, Korean, Indonesian, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, Polish, Swedish, Filipino, Malay, Russian, Romanian, Ukrainian, Greek, Czech, Danish, Finnish, Bulgarian, Croatian, Slovak, and Tamil; and `eleven_monolingual_v1`, a low-latency model specifically trained for English speech.

```py
from elevenlabs import generate, play

audio = generate(
  text="Hello! ‰Ω†Â•Ω! Hola! ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á! Bonjour! „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ! ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß! ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî! Ciao! Cze≈õƒá! –ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç! ‡Æµ‡Æ£‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç!",
  voice="Bella",
  model="eleven_multilingual_v2"
)

play(audio)
```

<details> <summary> Play </summary>

<i> Don't forget to unmute the player! </i>

</details>

## üó£Ô∏è Voices

List all your available voices with `voices()`.
```py
from elevenlabs import voices, generate

voices = voices()
audio = generate(text="Hello there!", voice=voices[0])
print(voices)
```

<details> <summary> Show output </summary>

```py
Voices(
    voices=[
        Voice(
            voice_id='21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM',
            name='Rachel',
            category='premade',
            settings=None,
        ),
        Voice(
            voice_id='AZnzlk1XvdvUeBnXmlld',
            name='Domi',
            category='premade',
            settings=None,
        ),
        ...
    ]
)
```

</details>

Build a voice object with custom settings to personalize the voice style, or call 
`client.voices.get_settings("your-voice-id")` to get the default settings for the voice.

```py
from elevenlabs import Voice, VoiceSettings, generate

audio = generate(
    text="Hello! My name is Bella.",
    voice=Voice(
        voice_id='EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL',
        settings=VoiceSettings(stability=0.71, similarity_boost=0.5, style=0.0, use_speaker_boost=True)
    )
)

play(audio)
```

</details>

## Clone Voice

Clone your voice in an instant. Note that voice cloning requires an API key, see below.

```py
from elevenlabs import clone, generate, play

voice = clone(
    name="Alex",
    description="An old American male voice with a slight hoarseness in his throat. Perfect for news", # Optional
    files=["./sample_0.mp3", "./sample_1.mp3", "./sample_2.mp3"],
)

audio = generate(text="Hi! I'm a cloned voice!", voice=voice)

play(audio)
```

## üöø Streaming

Stream audio in real-time, as it's being generated.

```py
from elevenlabs import generate, stream

audio_stream = generate(
  text="This is a... streaming voice!!",
  stream=True
)

stream(audio_stream)
```

### Input streaming
Stream text chunks into audio as it's being generated, with <1s latency. Note: if chunks don't end with space or punctuation (" ", ".", "?", "!"), the stream will wait for more text.
```py
from elevenlabs import generate, stream

def text_stream():
    yield "Hi there, I'm Eleven "
    yield "I'm a text to speech API "

audio_stream = generate(
    text=text_stream(),
    voice="Nicole",
    model="eleven_monolingual_v1",
    stream=True
)

stream(audio_stream)
```

## HTTP Client
The SDK also exposes an HTTP client that you can use to query our 
various endpoints. 

```python
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs

eleven = ElevenLabs(
  api_key="MY_API_KEY" # Defaulsts to ELEVEN_API_KEY
)
models = eleven.models.get_all()
```

## Async Client 
Use `AsyncElevenLabs` if you want to make API calls asynchronously. 

```python
import asyncio

from elevenlabs.client import AsyncElevenLabs

eleven = AsyncElevenLabs(
  api_key="MY_API_KEY" # Defaulsts to ELEVEN_API_KEY
)

async def print_models() -> None:
    models = eleven.models.get_all()
    print(models)

asyncio.run(print_models())
```

## Elevenlabs module
All of the ElevenLabs models are nested within the elevenlabs module.

## Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code, otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening an issue first to discuss with us! 

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
