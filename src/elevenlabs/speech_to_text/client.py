        Transcribe an audio or video file. If webhook is set to true, the request will be processed asynchronously and results sent to configured webhooks.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model_id : str
            The ID of the model to use for transcription, currently only 'scribe_v1' and 'scribe_v1_experimental' are available.

        enable_logging : typing.Optional[bool]
            When enable_logging is set to false zero retention mode will be used for the request. This will mean history features are unavailable for this request, including request stitching. Zero retention mode may only be used by enterprise customers.

        file : typing.Optional[core.File]
            See core.File for more documentation

        language_code : typing.Optional[str]
            An ISO-639-1 or ISO-639-3 language_code corresponding to the language of the audio file. Can sometimes improve transcription performance if known beforehand. Defaults to null, in this case the language is predicted automatically.

        tag_audio_events : typing.Optional[bool]
            Whether to tag audio events like (laughter), (footsteps), etc. in the transcription.

        num_speakers : typing.Optional[int]
            The maximum amount of speakers talking in the uploaded file. Can help with predicting who speaks when. The maximum amount of speakers that can be predicted is 32. Defaults to null, in this case the amount of speakers is set to the maximum value the model supports.

        timestamps_granularity : typing.Optional[SpeechToTextConvertRequestTimestampsGranularity]
            The granularity of the timestamps in the transcription. 'word' provides word-level timestamps and 'character' provides character-level timestamps per word.

        diarize : typing.Optional[bool]
            Whether to annotate which speaker is currently talking in the uploaded file.

        diarization_threshold : typing.Optional[float]
            Diarization threshold to apply during speaker diarization. A higher value means there will be a lower chance of one speaker being diarized as two different speakers but also a higher chance of two different speakers being diarized as one speaker (less total speakers predicted). A low value means there will be a higher chance of one speaker being diarized as two different speakers but also a lower chance of two different speakers being diarized as one speaker (more total speakers predicted). Can only be set when diarize=True and num_speakers=None. Defaults to None, in which case we will choose a threshold based on the model_id (0.22 usually).

        additional_formats : typing.Optional[AdditionalFormats]
            A list of additional formats to export the transcript to.

        file_format : typing.Optional[SpeechToTextConvertRequestFileFormat]
            The format of input audio. Options are 'pcm_s16le_16' or 'other' For `pcm_s16le_16`, the input audio must be 16-bit PCM at a 16kHz sample rate, single channel (mono), and little-endian byte order. Latency will be lower than with passing an encoded waveform.

        cloud_storage_url : typing.Optional[str]
            The valid AWS S3, Cloudflare R2 or Google Cloud Storage URL of the file to transcribe. Exactly one of the file or cloud_storage_url parameters must be provided. The file must be a valid publicly accessible cloud storage URL. The file size must be less than 2GB. URL can be pre-signed.

        webhook : typing.Optional[bool]
            Whether to send the transcription result to configured speech-to-text webhooks.  If set the request will return early without the transcription, which will be delivered later via webhook.

        webhook_id : typing.Optional[str]
            Optional specific webhook ID to send the transcription result to. Only valid when webhook is set to true. If not provided, transcription will be sent to all configured speech-to-text webhooks.

        temperature : typing.Optional[float]
            Controls the randomness of the transcription output. Accepts values between 0.0 and 2.0, where higher values result in more diverse and less deterministic results. If omitted, we will use a temperature based on the model you selected which is usually 0.

        seed : typing.Optional[int]
            If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed. Must be an integer between 0 and 2147483647.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        SpeechToTextChunkResponseModel
