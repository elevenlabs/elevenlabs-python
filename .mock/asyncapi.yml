      The Text-to-Speech WebSockets API is designed to generate audio from partial text input
      while ensuring consistency throughout the generated audio. Although highly flexible,
      the WebSockets API isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. It's well-suited for scenarios where:
        * The input text is being streamed or generated in chunks.
        * Word-to-audio alignment information is required.

      However, it may not be the best choice when:
        * The entire input text is available upfront. Given that the generations are partial,
          some buffering is involved, which could potentially result in slightly higher latency compared
          to a standard HTTP request.
        * You want to quickly experiment or prototype. Working with WebSockets can be harder and more
          complex than using a standard HTTP API, which might slow down rapid development and testing.

        try_trigger_generation:
          description: |
            This is an advanced setting that most users shouldn't need to use. It relates to our generation schedule.

            Use this to attempt to immediately trigger the generation of audio, overriding the `chunk_length_schedule`.
            Unlike flush, `try_trigger_generation` will only generate audio if our
            buffer contains more than a minimum
            threshold of characters, this is to ensure a higher quality response from our model.

            Note that overriding the chunk schedule to generate small amounts of
            text may result in lower quality audio, therefore, only use this parameter if you
            really need text to be processed immediately. We generally recommend keeping the default value of
            `false` and adjusting the `chunk_length_schedule` in the `generation_config` instead.

          description: |
            This is an advanced setting that most users shouldn't need to use. It relates to our
            generation schedule.

            Our WebSocket service incorporates a buffer system designed to optimize the Time To First Byte (TTFB) while maintaining high-quality streaming.

            All text sent to the WebSocket endpoint is added to this buffer and only when that buffer reaches a certain size is an audio generation attempted. This is because our model provides higher quality audio when the model has longer inputs, and can deduce more context about how the text should be delivered.

            The buffer ensures smooth audio data delivery and is automatically emptied with a final audio generation either when the stream is closed, or upon sending a `flush` command. We have advanced settings for changing the chunk schedule, which can improve latency at the cost of quality by generating audio more frequently with smaller text inputs.

            The `chunk_length_schedule` determines the minimum amount of text that needs to be sent and present in our
            buffer before audio starts being generated. This is to maximise the amount of context available to
            the model to improve audio quality, whilst balancing latency of the returned audio chunks.

            The default value for `chunk_length_schedule` is: [120, 160, 250, 290].

            This means that the first chunk of audio will not be generated until you send text that
            totals at least 120 characters long. The next chunk of audio will only be generated once a
            further 160 characters have been sent. The third audio chunk will be generated after the
            next 250 characters. Then the fourth, and beyond, will be generated in sets of at least 290 characters.

            Customize this array to suit your needs. If you want to generate audio more frequently
            to optimise latency, you can reduce the values in the array. Note that setting the values
            too low may result in lower quality audio. Please test and adjust as needed.

            Each item should be in the range 50-500.
